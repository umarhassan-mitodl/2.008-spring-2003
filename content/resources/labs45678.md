description: 'This is a manual for Labs IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII. This exercise requires
  student teams to design and manufacture a three-part, or four-part yo-yo.

  The goal is to follow a typical product design / manufacturing sequence.  These
  exercises provide an opportunity to apply what you have learned about CAD/CAM, to
  learn about commonly used

  manufacturing processes, and to recognize some issues concerning the optimization
  of a manufacturing process.'
